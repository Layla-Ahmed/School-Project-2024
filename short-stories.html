                        <h2>Behind the Story</h2>
                          <p>Our journey began a few years ago when I sketched a cat wearing glasses in my notebook. My best friend, Thimna, named him 'Professor Harry Hamilton,' inspired by our Natural Science teacher, Mr. Hastie, who also wore glasses and conducted experiments. But the real spark for our stories came when we saw Mr. Ronander, a school worker, riding his lawnmower. We instantly thought, 'What if we gave our quirky character a story of his own?' With that idea—and a touch of imagination—Professor Hamilton's lawnmower became a Pancake Mower, adding the funny twist we wanted. The first characters to join were Harry, along with his teenage neighbors Fred and Tom. Since then, we’ve added more books and comics to our collection, eventually inspiring a website dedicated to our wacky world. Over time, we've expanded and refined the site to become what you see today: a place for all things hilarious and Hamilton!</p>
